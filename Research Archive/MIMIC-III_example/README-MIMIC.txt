This folder contains code for the applied example using the MIMIC-III data set. Because of privacy reasons, the MIMIC-III data set itself cannot be shared!
For a replication the only the "LABEVENTS.csv" of the MIMIC-III data is necessary and needs to be added to the data folder.

The folders include: 

Code    - code for applying the model combinations (doing simulations with the applied data) and for creating the plot + table
data    - the mimic data itself (needs to be added because I am not allowed to share it)
plots   - the plots of the calibration lines
results - the results from the model combinations
renv    - for version control
