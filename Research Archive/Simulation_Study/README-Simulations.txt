This folder contains all code that is necessary to reproduce the findings of the report. 

The results folder contains the "raw" results of the simulation study. It can also be reproduced by the R-code in the "code" - "simulations" folder but depending on the computational capacity this can take days / weeks. 

Thus, I decided to include the raw results itself to facilitate reproducing figures and tables. All results are saved within the results.zip folder.
The results.zip folder needs to be unzipped and saved as a "results" folder (in the main "Simulation_Study" folder) for the rest of the code to work!

The folders in this main folder contain:

calibration(spaghetti)-plots - calibration (also called spaghetti) plots of the results and appendix saved as png
code			     - code to reproduce the "raw" results of the study and code to reproduce the tables / plots
results    		     - "raw" results of the simulation study (needs to be unzipped)
renv 			     - for version control
