The original study was conducted on the high performance computer of the University Medical Center Utrecht. We uploaded the "upload_to_hpc" folder, started the code and downloaded the results. The simulations ran on over 100 cores. Due to the immense computational time, is advised against running them on a single laptop/computer. We added a version where single iterations can be run on a single device in the "own_device" folder.
